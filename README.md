# ✨ Welcome to my portfolio ✨

I have not used any framework or library to write it, it uses only HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

Although I was inspired by some other great designers' and web developers' portfolios (especially their layouts and animations) my goal was to make my own from scratch.

I did my best to make it accessible, responsive and function properly if a browser blocks JavaScript but it can definitely be improved and I welcome constructive feedback and PRs.

## TO DO

- Spend some time to replace the image assets by using higher quality screenshots and device mockups.
